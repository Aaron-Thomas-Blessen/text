Made a new folder 'Alan' on desktop or anywhere

 C:\Users\Aaron\Desktop\Alan> git clone https://github.com/Aaron-Thomas-Blessen/text.git            #This  copies all files and file contents of Main branch of the repo to the folder Alan and adds the '.git' file all by itself. No need for git init, git add . , git commit -m "add text" etc. These commands are required if we make a new file or make changes to an existing one and want to add it to main branch or any other branch.

 C:\Users\Aaron\Desktop\Alan> git clone -b Aaron https://github.com/Aaron-Thomas-Blessen/text.git     #This  copies all files and file contents of  Aaron branch of the repo to the folder Alan and adds the '.git' file all by itself. Its same as above my clones Aaron;s branch.
